You could theoretically introduce too much input lag now having to use this for bunch i think that the simplest way to look at it is that it is not noticeable like that introduction of input lag is not noticeable if you have a high enough base frame rate like if you can hit 30 to 35 frames per second natively turning on frame generation is awesome it feels very smooth especially because you'll be running nvidia reflex to reduce input latency at the same time frame generation is an incredibly powerful tool i feel like the way that invite is implemented it is very impressive it just looks so good already it's only been out for a year i can only imagine we'll look like in three or four years time the last and latest tool of dss 3.5 is ray reconstruction which is actually gives you better looking and more efficient ray tracing like look at the difference between these two scenes here when you have reconstruction on there's just much more detail in that raised reflection now they're a enhanced gaming tech isn't perfect it's a lot better than it was from 2019 but occasionally you'll still see some artifacts but i think the biggest issues pop up when you lean too heavily on this ai stuff like if you have a native frame rate of let's say 20 frames per second and you turn on frame generation you're going to have a bad time like i don't think we're at the point yet we can have really weak gpus that just get hard carry by ai to the top at least not yet but in general when you have dlss capable games and you have modern nvidia gpus in a device you just get way better performance than you would expect at that price point
